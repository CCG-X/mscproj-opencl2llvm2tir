=====
ABOUT
=====
A barebones opencl synthetic application to show a basic kernel with pipes

* Intended targets are FPGAs, but can be extended for GPUs and other OPenCL devices. 
* However, for this code, the code compatibility and build files are for CPUs only as that is enough
for the project's scope.


=============
REQUIREMENTS
=============

1. For Intel CPU targets, you need Intel's OpenCL drivers and runtime installed, with OpenCL version 2.1. You can get it from here:
https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/opencl-drivers#latest_linux_SDK_release

=====
BUILD
=====

CPU TARGET
-----------------------

a) baseline (no channels):
> cd build_CPU
> make
> ./host.exe

b) channelized:
> cd build_CPU
> make CHANNELS=1
> ./host.exe


=====
NOTES
=====
DEBUG:: (kernel echoes messages to the screen)
- CPU/GPU is *always* run in debug mode.
